**Unit 2: Time Value Of Money: Future Value, Present Value, And Interest
Rates** <span id="2"></span> 
*Suppose you have the option of receiving $100 dollars today vs. $200 in
five years.  Which option would you choose?  How would you determine
which is the better deal?  Some of us would rather have less money today
vs. wait for more money tomorrow.  However, sometimes it pays to wait. 
Unit 2 introduces the concept of time value of money and explains how to
determine the value of money today vs. tomorrow by using finance tools
to determine present and future values.  Also, Unit 2 exposes the
concept of interest rates and how to apply them when multiple periods
are considered.  *

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 24 hours to complete.

**2.1.1 Definition of Time Value of Money** <span id="2.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 2.1.  The
concept called the “time value of money” assumes that individuals face
either an increase in prices in the economy as time passes in the form
of an inflation rate, such as a 4% annual inflation rate, or an
opportunity to put their savings in an investment account offering an
interest rate, such as 5% per year.  Therefore, under the “time value of
money” concept, you can see that $1000 that you can receive in two years
from today does not have the same value as $1000 today.  In fact, it
will have a lesser value today.  Likewise, if you receive $1000 today
and have the opportunity to put this money in an investment account
earning 5% per year, in two years you will have more than $1000.*

**2.1.2 Rates of Return** <span id="2.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 2.1.  Of
concern is the fact that a rate of return is usually expressed as a
percentage (e.g., 4%) but when you need to apply it in a calculation,
use it in decimal-form (e.g., 0.04 is the decimal-form of 4%, 0.10 is
the decimal-form of 10%, etc).  The same applies to the numerical
expressions of interest rates.*

**2.1.3 Simple Interest vs. Compound Interest** <span
id="2.1.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 2.1.  When you
need to calculate the future value of an amount using a simple interest
rate, you apply the interest rate only to the initial amount.  On the
contrary, when you calculate the future value of an amount using the
compound interest rate, you apply the interest rate not only to the
initial amount but also to amounts of interest earned.  The compound
interest rate is commonly used by banks, credit card companies, and any
other financial institution.  The simple interest rate is usually
applied to loans made in informal business deals, and even to loans
involving family members!*

**2.2 Future Value and Compounding** <span id="2.2"></span>

     Instructions: Read Section 2.4 from Chapter 2 in the textbook.
     This section gives you the future value formula and shows you how
    to use it with several examples in finance.  Also, make sure to
    answer the questions given at the end of Section 2.4 and compare
    your answers to the answers given at the end of Chapter 2 under the

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: You will notice that this reading is complementary to
    Section 2.4 in Dr. Ivo Welch’s textbook but notice how the future
    value formula is also expressed using the future value interest
    factor (FVIF).  Make sure to follow the mathematical calculations as
    shown in that reading.  This resource covers the topics outlined in
    sub-subunits 2.2.1 to 2.2.3.  This reading should take you
    approximately 0.5 hours to complete.

**2.2.1 Definition of Future Value** <span id="2.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 2.2.  The
future value of an initial amount is the future value of that amount in
“n” periods into the future given that the initial amount is subject to
a certain interest rate every period.*

**2.2.2 Future Value Formula** <span id="2.2.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 2.2.  The
future value (FV) formula when considering the same interest rate every
period is as follows:*  

*FV<sub>n</sub> = PV x (1 + i)<sup>n</sup>* **

*This formula is stating that in “n” periods from today the FV value of
an initial amount today, otherwise called the present value (PV), is
equal to the PV amount multiplied by (1 + i)<sup>n</sup>, where “i” is
the fixed interest rate received every period expressed in decimal-form.
 For example, if the interest rate is 5%, then 1+ i = 1 + 0.05 = 1.05.*
**2.2.3 Calculating Future Value on Your Calculator** <span
id="2.2.3"></span> 
*Note: When you use the FV formula as stated above in Subunit 2.2.2 and
use a calculator to compute it, make sure to separate (1 +
i)<sup>n</sup> from the PV amount by using parenthesis.  For example, to
calculate the FV in 5 years of $100 under a 10% annual interest rate, in
a typical calculator you will enter the amounts in the following way:
100x(1.10^5).  You will see that the final result is $161.05.  If your
calculator does not allow you to raise an amount to the power of a
number then you can just multiply (1+i) by itself for a total of “n”
times.  For example, (1.10)<sup>5</sup> is the same as
1.10x1.10x1.10x1.10x1.10.*

**2.3 Present Value and Discounting** <span id="2.3"></span>

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read Section 2.5 from Chapter 2 in the textbook.
     This section gives you the present value formula and shows you how
    to use it with several examples in finance.  Pay attention to the
    concept “capital budgeting,” which is another important concept in
    finance.  Also, make sure to answer the questions given at the end
    of Section 2.5 and compare your answers to the answers given at the
    end of Chapter 2 under the heading titled “Answers.”  This resource
    covers the topics outlined in sub-subunits 2.3.1 to 2.3.3.  This

     Instructions: Please view all three videos. The first video
    “Introduction to Present Value” shows the basic use of the Present
    Value (PV) formula when only one period is considered.  Secondly,
    the video “Present Value 2” applies the PV formula when different
    cash flows are considered in different periods.  Finally, “Present
    Value 3” will re-calculate the PV amounts when the interest rate
    changes.  This resource covers the topics outlined in sub-subunits
    2.3.1 to 2.3.3.   
      
     Watching these videos should take approximately 30 minutes.

**2.3.1 Definition of Present Value** <span id="2.3.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 2.3.  The
present value of a future amount that will be received in “n” periods
into the future is in today’s value.*

**2.3.2 Present Value Formula** <span id="2.3.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 2.3.  The
present value (PV) formula when considering the same interest rate every
period is as follows:  
    
 PV = FV<sub>n</sub> / (1 + i)<sup>n</sup>  
    
 This formula is stating that the present value (PV) of the future value
(FV) of an amount that will be received in “n” periods from today is
equal to the FV amount divided by (1 + i)<sup>n</sup>, where “i” is the
fixed interest rate received every period expressed in decimal-form.
 For example, if the interest rate is 5%, then 1+ i = 1 + 0.05 = 1.05.*

**2.3.3 Calculating Present Value on Your Calculator** <span
id="2.3.3"></span> 
*When you use the PV formula as stated above in Subunit 2.3.2 and use a
calculator to compute it, make sure to separate (1 + i)<sup>n</sup> from
the FV amount by using parenthesis.  For example, to calculate the PV of
$100 that will be received in 5 years from today under a 10% annual
interest rate, in a typical calculator you will enter the amounts in the
following way: 100/(1.10^5).  You will see that the final result is
$62.09. If your calculator does not allow you to raise an amount to the
power of a number then you can just multiply (1+i) by itself for a total
of “n” times.  For example, (1.10)<sup>5</sup> is the same as
1.10x1.10x1.10x1.10x1.10.*

**2.4 Variable Rates of Return** <span id="2.4"></span> 
-   **Reading: Dr. Ivo Welch’s Corporate Finance (3rd Edition): “Chapter
    5: Time-Varying Rates of Return and the Yield Curve”**
    Link: Dr. Ivo Welch’s *Corporate Finance (3rd Edition)*: “[Chapter
    5: Time-Varying Rates of Return and the Yield
    Curve](http://book.ivo-welch.info/fcgi-bin/ed3.fpl?Chapter5)”
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read Chapter 5 in the textbook in its entirety.  That
    chapter shows you how to use the present value (PV) and future value
    (FV) formulas when confronted with interest rates that are not fixed
    in time.  For instance, you learn in Chapter 5 about interest rates
    that are quoted on an annual basis but monthly cash flows need to be
    considered.  What do you think you need to do when you are given an
    annual interest rate but the periods you need to consider in the PV
    and FV formulas are months and not years?  This chapter explains how
    to modify those formulas given annual interest rates by monthly,
    weekly, or daily periods.  Also in this chapter, you learn about the
    role of the inflation rate in calculating interest rates and about
    the basic interest rate in the U.S. economy: U.S. Treasury rates.
     Also, make sure to answer the questions given at the end of each
    section in Chapter 5 and compare your answers to the answers given
    at the end of Chapter 5 in under the heading titled “Answers.”  This
    resource covers the topics outlined in sub-subunits 2.4.1 to 2.4.3.
     This reading should take you approximately 4 hours to complete.

     Instructions: Please view all four videos. The first video shows
    you how to use the future value formula when you are considering an
    interest rate that applies every six months but it is quoted on an
    annual basis.  The second video shows you how to use the future
    value formula when you are considering the annual interest rate on a
    daily basis.  The third video gives a review of what you learned
    from the first two videos.  The fourth video shows you about what it
    means to use an annual interest rate continuously.  This resource
    covers the topics outlined in sub-subunit 2.4.1.   
      
     Watching these videos should take approximately 40 minutes.

**2.4.1 Variable Rates of Return** <span id="2.4.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 2.4.  For this
topic, review “Section 5.1 Working With Time-Varying Rates of Return” in
the textbook.  That section shows you how to adjust the interest rate
when you are given an annual interest rate but you need to consider
monthly, weekly, or daily periods in the present and future value
calculations.  Also, make sure to watch the Khan videos listed under
subunit 2.4.*

**2.4.2 Inflation Rate** <span id="2.4.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 2.4.  For this
topic, review “Section 5.2 Inflation” in the textbook.  That section
shows you how to adjust the interest rate in the present and future
value calculations when you need to consider the role of the inflation
rate in a capital budgeting decision.*

**2.4.3 U.S. Treasuries and the Yield Curve** <span id="2.4.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 2.4.  For this
topic, review “Section 5.3 U.S. Treasuries and the Yield Curve,”
“Section 5.4 Why Does the Yield Curve Usually Slope Up?,” and “Section
5.5 Corporate Insights about Time-Varying Costs of Capital” in the
textbook.  Those sections expose you to the basic risk-free rate that
companies consider when comparing rates of returns of their investment
projects.*

     Instructions: Read Chapter 3 in the textbook.  This section
    highlights two applications in finance of the present value formula
    when confronted with equal amounts every period and shows you how to
    use it with several examples.  Also, make sure to answer the
    questions given at the end of each section in Chapter 3 and compare
    your answers to the answers given at the end of Chapter 3 under the
    heading titled “Answers.”  This resource covers the topics outlined
    in sub-subunits 2.5.1 to 2.5.2.  This reading should take you
    approximately 4 hours to complete.

**2.5.1 Perpetuities** <span id="2.5.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 2.5.  A
perpetuity is a special financial account that pays the same amount each
period forever.  It is rarely used in finance today.  To calculate the
present value of a perpetuity (PV<sub>P</sub>), use the following
formula:  
    
 PV<sub>P</sub> = A / i  
    
 This formula is stating that the total present value of an amount (A)
that is paid every period until infinity is equal to “A” divided by “i”,
where “i” is the fixed interest rate received every period expressed in
decimal-form.  For example, if the interest rate is 5%, then i =  0.05.
 Due to the nature of this account, without a definite expiration date,
the future value cannot be computed (or, using mathematical logic, the
future value of a perpetuity is equal to infinity).*

**2.5.2 Annuities** <span id="2.5.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 2.5. An annuity
is a special financial account that requires the same amount payment
each period up to a limited number of periods.  Annuities are common in
finance.  Examples of annuities are: mortgage loans, auto loans, student
loans, and retirement savings accounts.  
    
 To calculate the present value of an annuity (PV<sub>A</sub>), use the
following formula:  
    
 PV<sub>A</sub> = (A / i) x [1- (1 + i)<sup>-n</sup>]  
    
 That formula is stating that the total present value of an amount (A)
that is paid every period until “n” periods into the future into an
account under an interest rate (i) is equal to “A” divided by
“i<sup>“</sup>and then multiplied by the expression in brackets.  Notice
that (1 + i)<sup>-n</sup> has the power to the negative “n.” The “i” is
the fixed interest rate applied every period expressed in decimal-form. 
For example, if the interest rate is 5%, then  
 i =  0.05. This calculation is normally used to calculate monthly
mortgage loan and student payments that are fixed for a long period of
time, say 240 months. Using that formula, a loan officer solves for the
monthly loan payment, the A, given a fixed monthly interest rate for a
loan that will be repaid in “n” months with a beginning balance equal to
the PV<sub>A</sub>.  
    
 On the contrary, the future value formula of an annuity is used for
calculating retirement savings accounts that are liquidated at the end
of a certain future period.  To calculate the future value of an annuity
(FV<sub>A</sub>), use the following formula:  
    
 FV<sub>A</sub> = (A / i) x [(1 + i)<sup>n</sup> - 1]  
    
 That formula is stating that the total future value of an amount (A)
that is paid every period until “n” periods into the future into an
account under an interest rate (i) is equal to “A” divided by “i”and
then multiplied by the expression in brackets.  Notice that (1 +
i)<sup>n</sup> has the power to the positive “n.”  The “i” is the fixed
interest rate applied every period expressed in decimal-form.  For
example, if the interest rate is 5%, then i = 0.05.  Using that formula,
you will be able to know how much you will have in your retirement
savings account at the end of “n” periods  when you make equal payments
every period and earn a fixed interest rate every period.*
