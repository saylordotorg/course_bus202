**Unit 1: Introduction To Finance, Financial Statements, And Financial
Analysis** <span id="1"></span> 
*As noted in the course introduction, finance is a broad subject and
financial decisions are all around us.  Whether you work on Wall Street
or in a small company, finance is vital to every business.  Therefore,
understanding the fundamentals of finance is vital to your business
education. This introductory unit addresses fundamental concepts of
finance, stocks,  and bonds.  Also, Unit 1 exposes the importance of
understanding ratios for financial statement analysis and analysis of
cash flows.  The main ratios explained are: solvency (or liquidity
ratios), financial ratios, profitability ratios, and market value
ratios.  In addition, you will learn about financial growth, what
financial factors determine growth, the importance of maintaining a
sustainable growth rate, and how to use financial statement information
to manage growth.  Consider this situation: You are the manager of a
small retail chain and your boss has given you the task of deciding
whether to invest in a second store.  You know that adding a second
store means greater potential for growth.  However, you also know that
adding a new store will require spending cash.  Facing this tough
decision, how could you determine whether the company can “handle” such
an investment?  The answer might lie in ratio analysis.  This section
will explain how to use financial ratios to help you make these types of
business decisions.  *

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 30 hours to complete.

**1.3.1 Balance Sheet Statement** <span id="1.3.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 1.3.  A balance
sheet statement is an account of the value of assets, liabilities, and
net worth of a company.  It is always considered during a point in time,
such as December 31, 2011.  Assets are things that a company owns;
whereas liabilities are things that a company owes.  Assets minus
liabilities results in the net worth of a company.*

**1.3.2 Income Statement** <span id="1.3.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 1.3.  An income
statement is an account of the revenues (net sales), costs, expenses,
and taxes of a company during a period of time, say from December 31,
2011 to December 31, 2012.  The goal of an income statement is to
compute the net profits of a company and all the different items
involved.*

**1.3.3 Cash Flow Statement** <span id="1.3.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 1.3.  The cash
flow statement keeps tracks of a company’s uses and sources of cash.  By
cash, it does not only mean “paper money bills and coins”; it also
refers to credit card (or debit card) debits and credits, payments and
receipts in check or money orders, and so on.*

**1.3.4 Accrual Basis Accounting vs. Cash Accounting** <span
id="1.3.4"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 1.3.  An
accountant, who is responsible for preparing financial statements, is
concerned with accrual basis accounting; whereas, the financial analyst
or manager is concerned with cash-basis accounting by keeping track of
the real uses and sources of cash.  Make sure to know this difference.*
