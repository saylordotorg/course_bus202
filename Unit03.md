**Unit 3: Capital Budgeting Techniques** <span id="3"></span> 
*Unit 3 shows how a financial manager makes capital investment decisions
using financial tools.  It is especially the case that this unit
addresses the concept of capital budgeting and how to evaluate
investment projects using the net present value calculations, internal
rate of return criteria, profitability index, and the payback period
method.  In particular, this unit will teach you how to determine which
cash flows are relevant (should be considered) when making an investment
decision.  Say for instance, you have been asked to give your
recommendation about buying or not buying a new building.  As the
financial manager, it is your task to identify cash flows that, in some
way or another, affect the value of the investment (in this case the
building).  Also, this unit explains how to calculate “incremental” cash
flows when evaluating a new project, which can also be considered as the
difference in future cash flows under two scenarios: when a new
investment project is being considered and when it is not.  Make sure to
complete Unit 2 first before engaging in Unit 3 as this unit is
considered the advanced portion using the financial techniques that are
explained in Unit 2, such as the present and future value formulas.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 23.45 hours to complete.

    2: Present Value: “Section 2.6: Net Present Value” and Chapter 4: A
    First Encounter with Capital Budgeting Rules: “Section 4.1: Net
    Present Value”**
    Link: Dr. Ivo Welch’s *Corporate Finance (3rd Edition)*: Chapter 2:
    Present Value: “[Section 2.6: Net Present
    Value](http://book.ivo-welch.info/fcgi-bin/ed3.fpl?PPage48)” (HTML)
    and Chapter 4: A First Encounter with Capital Budgeting Rules:
    “[Section 4.1: Net Present
    Value](http://book.ivo-welch.info/fcgi-bin/ed3.fpl?Chapter4)”
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read Section 2.6 from Chapter 2 and Section 4.1 from
    Chapter 4 in the textbook.  Section 2.6 gives you the “net present
    value” (NPV) concept and shows you how to use it with several
    examples in finance.  Pay special attention to the “NPV capital
    budgeting rule,” which is another important concept in finance.
     Section 4.1 revisits the concept of “net present value” that is
    explained in Section 2.6.  This concept is one of the tools in
    finance that is used for making investment decisions.  Also, make
    sure to answer the questions given at the end of Sections 2.6 and
    4.1 and compare your answers to the answers given at the end of
    Chapters 2 and 4 under the heading titled “Answers.”  This resource
    covers the topics outlined in sub-subunits 3.1.1 to 3.1.3.  This
    reading should take you approximately 4 hours to complete.

**3.1.1 Definition of Net Present Value** <span id="3.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 3.1.  When
evaluating a project that will take place in the future, the net present
value is usually applied in finance.  The net present value is the
present value of all future benefits minus the present value of all
future costs.*

**3.1.2 NPV Capital Budgeting Rule** <span id="3.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 3.1.  When
deciding whether or not to invest in a new business project, such as a
store expansion, the net present value (NPV) rule in capital budgeting
is to accept that project only if the NPV of the project is greater than
or equal to $0. I n addition, when choosing between projects, the NPV
rule is to accept that project with the highest NPV.*

**3.1.3 NPV Formula** <span id="3.1.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 3.1.  The net
present value (NPV) formula is stated as follows:  
    
 NPV = present value of all benefits – present value of all costs  
    
 The details of that formula can be explained using a cash flow amount
represented by C<sub>t</sub> in period “t” for each benefit and each
cost.  For example, when a project has an initial upfront cost in period
0, the present value of that cash flow is C<sub>0</sub>.  Suppose for
example that you are evaluating the NPV of an investment project that
costs C<sub>0</sub>, which is paid in the beginning, and provides
benefits for the next three years represented by cash flows
C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, and C<sub>3</sub>.  The NPV of this
project with an interest rate of “i” is computed as follows:  
    
 NPV = [C<sub>1</sub>/(1+i)] + [C<sub>2</sub>/(1+i)<sup>2</sup>] +
[C<sub>3</sub>/(1+i)<sup>3</sup>] - C<sub>0</sub>*

    Internal Rate of Return
    (IRR)](http://book.ivo-welch.info/fcgi-bin/ed3.fpl?PPage86)”
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read Section 4.2 from Chapter 4 in the textbook.
     That section highlights another important capital budgeting concept
    in finance that is used for making investment decisions.  Also, make
    sure to answer the questions given at the end of Section 4.2 and
    compare your answers to the answers given at the end of Chapter 4
    under the heading titled “Answers.”  This resource covers the topics
    outlined in sub-subunits 3.2.1 to 3.2.3.  This reading should take
    you approximately 2 hours to complete.

**3.2.1 Definition of Internal Rate of Return** <span
id="3.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 3.2.  When
evaluating a project that will take place in the future, the return of
that project is computed and then compared to alternative returns.
 Recall that a return in the language of finance is expressed as a
percentage, which is technically called a rate of return.  The internal
rate of return (IRR) is the return of project when its NPV is set to $0.
 *

**3.2.2 IRR Capital Budgeting Rule** <span id="3.2.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 3.2.  When
deciding whether or not to invest in a new business project, such as a
store expansion, the internal rate of return (IRR) rule in capital
budgeting is to accept that project only if its IRR is greater than the
average cost of capital in the economy, industry, or in a company.  For
example, if you have a project with an IRR of 10% but interest rates on
business loans are 20%, then it seems that you will lose money if your
company is taking out loans from a bank with a 20% interest rate in
order to buy new machinery or expand operations that will return 10%.
 In addition, when choosing between projects, the IRR rule is to accept
that project with the highest IRR.*

**3.2.3 IRR Formula** <span id="3.2.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 3.2.  Using the
example in sub-subunit 3.1.3, the IRR of a three-year project with an
initial cost of C<sub>0</sub> is computed as follows:  
    
 $0 = [C<sub>1</sub>/(1+IRR)] + [C<sub>2</sub>/(1+IRR)<sup>2</sup>] +
[C<sub>3</sub>/(1+IRR)<sup>3</sup>] - C<sub>0</sub>  
    
 In the formula above you might be wondering how you can solve for the
IRR as the algebraic mechanics look cumbersome.  With special computer
software, and even with Microsoft Excel, you can solve for the IRR.
 Look at Exhibit 4.2 in Chapter 4 of the textbook on page 66 for a
demonstration in Excel.*

**3.3 Profitability Index** <span id="3.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: Dr. Ivo Welch’s Corporate Finance (3rd Edition): Chapter
    4: A First Encounter with Capital Budgeting Rules: “Section 4.3: The
    Profitability Index”**
    Link: Dr. Ivo Welch’s *Corporate Finance (3rd Edition)*: Chapter 4:
    A First Encounter with Capital Budgeting Rules: “[Section 4.3: The
    Profitability
    Index](http://book.ivo-welch.info/fcgi-bin/ed3.fpl?PPage95)”
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read Section 4.3 from Chapter 4 in the textbook.
     That section highlights another important capital budgeting concept
    in finance that is used for making investment decisions when the
    scale of projects differs.  The profitability index rule applies
    well when projects that differ in size need to be compared.  Also,
    make sure to answer the questions given at the end Section 4.3 and
    compare your answers to the answers given at the end of Chapter 4
    under the heading titled “Answers.”  This resource covers the topics
    outlined in sub-subunits 3.3.1 to 3.3.3.  This reading should take
    you approximately 2 hours to complete.  
        
     Terms of Use: Please respect the copyright and terms of use
    displayed on the webpage above.

**3.3.1 Definition of Profitability Index** <span id="3.3.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 3.3.  When
comparing the net present value (NPV) of different projects that vary in
size, the profitability index (PI) of each project can be computed.  The
PI is computed by taking the present value of the benefits divided by
the present value of the costs.  The PI is, therefore, a relative
measure for comparing projects that differ in scale.  For example, if a
small project has an NPV of $4 million and a large project has an NPV of
$200 million, using the NPV rule you are most likely to choose the large
project.  The problem is that the large project required a larger
investment.  However, if you find that the small project has a PI of
5.00 and the large project has a PI of 2.00, your best option under this
criterion is to choose the small project as it gives you more relative
net benefits than the large project.*

**3.3.2 PI Capital Budgeting Rule** <span id="3.3.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 3.3.  When
choosing between projects that vary in scale, the PI rule is to accept
that project with the highest PI.*

**3.3.3 PI Formula** <span id="3.3.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 3.3.  The
profitability index (PI) formula is stated as follows:  
    
 PI = present value of all benefits / present value of all costs  
    
 The details of that formula can be explained using a cash flow amount
represented by C<sub>t</sub> in period “t” for each benefit and each
cost. For example, when a project has an initial upfront cost in period
0, the present value of that cash flow is C<sub>0</sub>.  Suppose for
example that you are evaluating the PI of an investment project that
costs C<sub>0</sub>, which is paid in the beginning, and provides
benefits for the next three years represented by cash flows
C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, and C<sub>3</sub>.  The PI of this project
with an interest rate of “i” is computed as follows:  
    
 PI = { [C<sub>1</sub>/(1+i)] + [C<sub>2</sub>/(1+i)<sup>2</sup>] +
[C<sub>3</sub>/(1+i)<sup>3</sup>] } / C<sub>0</sub>*

**3.4 Payback Period Method** <span id="3.4"></span> 
-   **Reading: Dr. Ivo Welch’s Corporate Finance (3rd Edition): Chapter
    4: A First Encounter with Capital Budgeting Rules: “Section 4.4: The
    Payback Capital Budgeting Rule”**
    Link: Dr. Ivo Welch’s *Corporate Finance (3rd Edition)*: Chapter 4:
    A First Encounter with Capital Budgeting Rules: “[Section 4.4: The
    Payback Capital Budgeting
    Rule](http://book.ivo-welch.info/fcgi-bin/ed3.fpl?PPage96)” (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read Section 4.4 from Chapter 4 in the textbook.
     That section highlights a simple capital budgeting concept in
    finance that is used for making investment decisions.  The payback
    period method is often used by small-business owners.  Also, make
    sure to answer the questions given at the end of Section 4.4 and
    compare your answers to the answers given at the end of Chapter 4
    under the heading titled “Answers.”  This resource covers the topics
    outlined in sub-subunits 3.4.1 to 3.4.3.  This reading should take
    you approximately 2 hours to complete.  
        
     Terms of Use: Please respect the copyright and terms of use
    displayed on the webpage above.

**3.4.1 Definition of Payback Period Method** <span id="3.4.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 3.4.  The
payback period (PP) method is a simple way for comparing the feasibility
between projects.  It is a measure that tells you how long a project
takes to recover its initial investment.  *

**3.4.2 PP Capital Budgeting Rule** <span id="3.4.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 3.4.  When
choosing between projects, the PP rule is to accept that project with
the shortest PP.  For example, if project A takes 5 years to recover its
initial investment but project B takes 1 year, then under this method it
is best to choose project B.  The PP method, as you can see, is very
simple and may lead to erroneous decisions because it does not tell you
anything about the size of the returns.  Will you change your mind
knowing that project A is a 7-year project that will give you a $50
million profit compared to project B that is a 2-year project that will
only give you a $1 million profit?*

**3.4.3 PP Formula** <span id="3.4.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 3.4.  The
payback period (PP) method is computed by counting the time (in years,
months, or days) that it takes for a project to recoup its initial
investment.  For example, suppose that a 3-year project that costs
$100,000 will give you benefits of $50,000 in the first year, $100,000
in the second year, and $150,000 in the third year.  The PP for this
project is 1.5 years as it will take 1 year and 6 months to recover the
entire $100,000.  Notice that the net profit of this project is
$200,000!*

**3.5 Evaluating Projects Incrementally** <span id="3.5"></span> 
-   **Reading: Dr. Ivo Welch’s Corporate Finance (3rd Edition): Chapter
    12: Capital Budgeting Applications and Pitfalls: “Section 12.5:
    Evaluating Projects Incrementally”**
    Link: Dr. Ivo Welch’s *Corporate Finance (3rd Edition)*: Chapter 12:
    Capital Budgeting Applications and Pitfalls: "[Section 12.5:
    Evaluating Projects
    Incrementally](http://book.ivo-welch.info/fcgi-bin/ed3.fpl?PPage376)"
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read Section 12.5 from Chapter 12 in the textbook.
     That section introduces you to the “incremental” method for
    calculating the net present value of a project dealing with a
    replacement of an existing project.  For example, suppose that the
    owners of a printing shop became aware of a new printing machine
    that is more efficient that the current one.  The investment
    question is: Should this company replace the current machine with
    the newer but more expensive one?  Using the net present value
    method, the best choice is to replace the current machine with the
    new one only if the new one creates added benefits.  This means that
    as long as the net present value of the new machine is higher than
    the net present value under the current one.  This is in other words
    what in finance is called the “incremental” approach.  Also, make
    sure to answer the questions given at the end of Section 12.5 and
    compare your answers to the answers given at the end of Chapter 12
    under the heading titled “Answers.”  This resource covers the topics
    outlined in sub-subunits 3.5.1 to 3.5.3.  This reading should take
    you approximately 3 hours to complete.

*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 3.5.  The MACRS
depreciation schedule is used to estimate the current value of a
physical asset, such as a computer, at any moment of time of this
asset’s life.  That value is called the “book value.”*

**3.5.3 Incremental Operating Cash Flows** <span id="3.5.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 3.5.  When a
replacement project is being considered, the incremental operating cash
flows need to be computed every period starting with period 1 as
follows:  
  *

*incremental C<sub>1</sub> = C<sub>1</sub> from the new project –
C<sub>1</sub> from the current project*

**3.5.4 Terminal Cash Flow** <span id="3.5.4"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 3.5.  When a
replacement project is being considered, the terminal cash flow is the
cash flow that will be generated in the last period of the project.
 This is an important concept when machines with a long life are
intended to be used for short periods until the end of a project.  After
the project is over, a long-lasting machine could either be sold to a
buyer in the market at the given market price or sold as scrap for a
lower amount than its remaining book value.*
