**Unit 4: Risk And Return** <span id="4"></span> 
*Unit 4 provides an explanation of the relationship between risk and
return.  Every investment decision carries a certain amount of risk. 
Therefore, the role of the financial manager is to understand how to
calculate the “riskiness” of an investment so that he or she can make
sound financial and business decisions.  For example, you are the
financial manager for a large corporation and your boss has asked you to
choose between two investment proposals.  Investment A is a textile
plant in a remote part of a third world country.  This plant has the
capacity to generate $50 million dollars in yearly profits.  Investment
B is a textile plant located in the United States, near a small Virginia
Town with a rich textile industry tradition.  However, investment B’s
capacity for profits is only $30 million (due to higher startup and
operating costs).  You are the financial manager.  Which option do you
chose?  While investment A has the capacity to yield significantly
higher profits, there is a great deal of risk that must be taken into
consideration.  Investment B has a much lower profit capacity, but the
risk is also much lower.  This relationship between risk and return is
explained in this unit. Specifically, you will learn how to compute the
level of risk by calculating expected values and the standard deviation.
 Also, you will learn about handling risk in a portfolio with different
investments and how to measure the expected performance of a stock
investment when it is being affected by the overall performance of a
stock market.*

     Instructions: Read Sections 6.1 and 6.2 from Chapter 6 in the
    textbook.  Section 6.1 introduces you to statistical concepts in
    finance such as the “expected value” (an average) and the “standard
    deviation.”  The sections also introduce the different types of
    investors commonly found in the real-world: 1) individuals who like
    to take on risky investment projects, known as “risk-seekers,” 2)
    individuals who do not like to take on risky investment projects,
    known as “risk-averters,” and 3) individuals who are neutral
    concerning risky propositions, known as “risk-neutrals.”  Section
    6.2 explains several real-world credit instruments used today.
     Also, make sure to answer the questions given at the end of
    Sections 6.1 and 6.2 and compare your answers to the answers given
    at the end of Chapter 6 under the heading titled “Answers.”  This
    resource covers the topics outlined in sub-subunits 4.1.1 to 4.1.3.

**4.1.1 Expected Value** <span id="4.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 4.1. The
expected value is simply an average but with probabilities attached. For
example, suppose that you have these three possible investment outcomes
with their respective probabilities of occurring:*  

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><em>Investment Outcome</em></td>
<td align="left"><em>Probability</em></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><em>Profit $100,000</em></td>
<td align="left"><em>0.30</em></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><em>Profit$50,000</em></td>
<td align="left"><em>0.40</em></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><em>No profit and no loss</em></td>
<td align="left"><em>0.30</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

*Notice that the sum of these probabilities needs to add up to 1.00 (or
100%).  To compute your “average” profits, you need to consider their
probabilities.  This average is normally called the “expected value” in
statistics.  Using this example, the expected value is computed as
follows: (100,000x0.30) + (50,000x0.40) + (0x0.30) = 30,000 + 20,000 + 0
= 50,000.  Therefore, you expect to receive $50,000 from this investment
project.  In general, the expected value formula is:  
    
 Expected Value = (outcome A x probability of A) + (outcome B x
probability of B) + ... + (outcome of Z x probability of Z)  
    
 where the sum of the probabilities add up to 1.00.*
**4.1.2 Standard Deviation** <span id="4.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 4.1.  The
standard deviation does not have an intuitive meaning, but it is a
measure of risk in finance.  When you are facing an investment project
with several possible outcomes and you know their respective
probabilities, you learned from sub-subunit 4.1.1 that you can compute
the expected value of an investment project.  But when you also need to
know the level of risk, you can compute the standard deviation as
follows:  
    
             Standard Deviation = square root of   
                                                  (outcome A – expected
value)<sup>2 </sup> x  probability of A  
                                                 + (outcome B – expected
value)<sup>2 </sup> x probability of B  
                                                 + ...   
                                                 + (outcome Z – expected
value)<sup>2 </sup> x probability of Z  
    
 where the sum of the probabilities add up to 1.00.*

**4.1.3 Risk-Return Tradeoff** <span id="4.1.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 4.1.  In
finance, an investor will take on more risk only if the return is
higher, or vice versa.  This is what we call in finance the “risk-return
tradeoff.*

     Section 8.1 shows you how to compute the expected value and the

    8.1 and compare your answers to the answers given at the end of
    Chapter 8 under the heading titled “Answers.”  This reading should

    Portfolios and Conglomerate Firms”**
    Link: Dr. Ivo Welch’s *Corporate Finance (3rd Edition)*: Chapter 8:

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read Sections 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5 from Chapter 8 in the
    textbook.  Section 8.3 introduces you to the concepts of “market
    betas.”  Make sure to pay special attention to the statistical model
    behind an asset’s expected return calculated from a market’s beta. 
    The market beta effect is simply the relationship between the stock
    performance of the overall stock market and an individual stock’s
    performance.  If the market beta has a positive value, it means that
    the individual stock’s performance will move in the same direction
    as the market’s performance.  And if the market beta is negative, it
    means that the individual stock’s performance will move in opposite
    direction.  Sections 8.4 and 8.5 give you several real-world
    examples of market betas.  Also, make sure to answer the questions
    given at the end of Sections 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5 and compare your
    answers to the answers given at the end of Chapter 8 under the
    heading titled “Answers.”  This reading should take you
    approximately 4 hours to complete.
