**Unit 5: Corporate Capital Structure, Cost Of Capital, And Taxes**
<span id="5"></span> 
*Does it matter whether a company’s assets are being financed with 50%
from a bank loan and 50% from investors’ money?  Does that form of
capital structure, where 50% of assets comes from debt and 50% from
equity, influence how a company succeeds in business?  This unit
addresses these questions by focusing on the theory of capital
structure.  Specifically, Unit 5 explains the concept of capital
structure and introduces you to the most common formula used when
comparing a company’s return to the cost of capital: The weighted
average cost of capital (WACC).  Also, Unit 5 exposes the concept of how
tax policy affects a company’s true cost of capital.  *

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 18.35 hours to complete.

**5.1 Capital Structure Finance Theory: Modigliani-Miller** <span
id="5.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Dr. Ivo Welch’s Corporate Finance (3rd Edition): Chapter
    16: Capital Structure in a Perfect Market: “Section 16.1:
    Maximization of Equity Value or Firm Value?,” “Section 16.2:
    Modigliani and Miller: The Informal Way,” and “Section 16.3:
    Modigliani and Miller: The Formal Way”**
    Link: Dr. Ivo Welch’s Corporate Finance (3rd Edition): Chapter 16:
    Capital Structure in a Perfect Market: “[Section 16.1: Maximization
    of Equity Value or Firm
    Value?](http://book.ivo-welch.info/fcgi-bin/ed3.fpl?Chapter16)”
    (HTML), “[Section 16.2: Modigliani and Miller: The Informal
    Way](http://book.ivo-welch.info/fcgi-bin/ed3.fpl?PPage535)” (HTML),
    and “[Section 16.3: Modigliani and Miller: The Formal
    Way](http://book.ivo-welch.info/fcgi-bin/ed3.fpl?PPage537)” (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read Sections 16.1, 16.2, and 16.3 from Chapter 16 in
    the textbook. Section 16.1 highlights the role and duty of the
    managers in a corporation.  Pay particular attention to the reasons
    behind maximizing firm value and how current (ex ante) and future
    (ex post) factors affect the capital structure of a firm, such as
    debt and equity.  Recall from subunit 1.2 (Chapter 15) that
    corporations raise money through debt (bonds and loans) or equity
    (stocks and profits) as Section 16.1 also addresses those issues.
     Sections 16.2 and 16.3 introduce you to the Modigliani-Miller
    theory in finance: that firm value is independent of the capital
    structure of a firm.  Also, make sure to answer the questions given
    at the end of Sections 16.1, 16.2, and 16.3 and compare your answers
    to the answers given at the end of Chapter 16 under the heading
    titled “Answers.”  This resource covers the topics outlined in
    sub-subunits 5.1.1 and 5.1.2.  This reading should take you
    approximately 2 hours to complete.

**5.1.1 Maximization of Firm Value** <span id="5.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 5.1.  The goal
of managers in a corporation is to maximize firm value.  This means that
managers need to make business decisions that improve the efficiency and
competitiveness of a firm.*

**5.1.2 Modigliani-Miller Theorem** <span id="5.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 5.1.  According
to the Modigliani-Miller theorem in finance: Firm value is independent
of the capital structure of a firm.  This means that how a firm is
financed, for example 80% equity and 20% debt vs. 50% equity and 50%
debt, has no effect on the value of the firm.*

     Instructions: Read Sections 16.4, 16.5, and 16.6 from Chapter 16 in
    the textbook.  Those sections introduce you to the weighted average
    cost of capital (WACC) method for computing the average cost of
    capital of a firm.  Pay particular attention to the WACC formula
    given in Section 16.5.  Also, make sure to answer the questions
    given at the end of Sections 16.4, 16.5, and 16.6 and compare your
    answers to the answers given at the end of Chapter 16 under the
    heading titled “Answers.”  This resource covers the topics outlined
    in sub-subunits 5.2.1 and 5.2.2.  This reading should take you

**5.2.1 Cost of Capital** <span id="5.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 5.2.  The cost
of capital usually refers to: The interest rate on a loan (cost of
debt), the interest rate placed on a corporate bond (cost of debt), and
the return demanded by shareholders (cost of equity).*

**5.2.2 Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) Formula** <span
id="5.2.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 5.2.  Suppose
that a company has total financing where 20% comes from bonds, 50% from
a loan, and 30% from shareholders’ equity.  The bonds pay a 10% interest
rate, the loan has a 5% interest rate, and shareholders require an 8%
return. Under this scenario, this company’s WACC is:  
    
 WACC = (.20x10) + (.50x5) (.30x8) = 6.9%  
    
 This means that on average this company has a cost of capital of 6.9%.
In general, the WACC formula is:  
    
 WACC = (percentage of total financing from A source x interest rate of
A)  
 + (percentage of total financing from B source x interest rate of B)  
 + ... + (percentage of total financing from Z source x interest rate of
Z)  
    
 where percentage of total financing from A + percentage of total
financing from B+ ... + percentage of total financing from Z = 1.00.*

**5.3 Taxes and Capital Structure** <span id="5.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: Dr. Ivo Welch’s Corporate Finance (3rd Edition): "Chapter
    17: Taxes and Capital Structure”**
    Link: Dr. Ivo Welch’s *Corporate Finance (3rd Edition)*: "[Chapter
    17: Taxes and Capital
    Structure](http://book.ivo-welch.info/fcgi-bin/ed3.fpl?Chapter17)”
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read Chapter 17 in the textbook.  Sections 17.1,
    17.2, and 17.3 show you how to adjust the WACC formula when we
    consider a realistic issue concerning loans: Interest payments on
    loans are tax-deductible.   Follow the examples given in Sections
    17.4 through 17.8 about PepsiCo’s case and the U.S. tax system.
     Also, make sure to answer the questions given at the end of each
    section from Chapter 17 and compare your answers to the answers
    given at the end of Chapter 17 under the heading titled “Answers.”
     This resource covers the topics outlined in sub-subunits 5.3.1 and
    5.3.2.  This reading should take you approximately 6 hours to
    complete.  
        
     Terms of Use: Please respect the copyright and terms of use
    displayed on the webpage above.

**5.3.1 Cost of Debt and Taxes** <span id="5.3.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 5.3.  According
to the U.S. tax system and GAAP rules, interest payments on loans are
deductible from operating profits.  This means, as a company takes out a
loan to finance an asset (e.g., to buy a new machine), the company will
be able to deduct the interest payments and thus pay less taxes on
profits.  Essentially, this makes the cost of the loan be less than the
interest rate.  The cost of the loan is:  
  
 cost of loan = interest rate x (1 – tax rate)  
    
 where the interest rate and tax rate are expressed in decimal form
(e.g., .10 for 10%, 0.05 for 5%, etc).*

**5.3.2 WACC and Taxes** <span id="5.3.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 5.3.  Suppose
that a company has total financing where 20% comes from bonds, 50% from
a loan, and 30% from shareholders’ equity.  The bonds pay a 10% interest
rate, the loan has a 5% interest rate, and shareholders require an 8%
return.  Also, consider that the interest loan payments are
tax-deductible and the corporate tax rate is 40%.  Under this scenario,
this company’s WACC is:  
    
 WACC = (.20x10) + (.50x5)(1-.40) + (.30x8) = 5.9%  
    
 This means that on average this company has a cost of capital of 5.9%.
 In general, the WACC formula is:  
    
 WACC = (percentage of total financing from debt source x interest rate
of debt)(1 – tax rate)  
 + (percentage of total financing from B source x interest rate of B)  
 + ... + (percentage of total financing from Z source x interest rate of
Z)  
    
 where percentage of total financing from A + percentage of total
financing from B+ ... + percentage of total financing from Z = 1.00.*
