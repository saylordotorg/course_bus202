Course Syllabus for "BUS202: Principles of Finance"
---------------------------------------------------

In [BUS103: Financial
Accounting](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bus103/), we learned that
firms are required to keep detailed financial records so that organized
reports can be distributed to managers, shareholders, and government
regulators.  Principles of Finance will focus on what these managers,
investors, and government agencies do with this information.  It is an
introductory course to various fields of finance and is comparable in
content to courses that other institutions label as “corporate finance”
or “financial management.” Finance is a broad term; you will find that
both managers that compile the financial reports we discussed in
financial accounting and stockbrokers working on Wall Street will claim
that they work in finance.  So what exactly is finance?  Finance is the
science of fund management.  It is distinct from accounting in that,
whereas accounting aims at organizing and compiling past information,
finance is geared towards deciding what to do with that information. In
this course, you will be exposed to a number of different sub-fields
within finance.  You will learn how to determine which projects have the
best potential payoff, to manage investments, and even to value stocks. 
In the end, you will discover that all finance boils down to one
concept: return.  In essence, finance asks: “If I give you money today,
how much money will I get back in the future?”  Though the answer to
this question will vary widely from case to case, by the time you finish
this course, you will know how to find the answer. You will learn how to
use financial concepts such as the time value of money, pro forma
financial statements, financial ratio analysis, capital budgeting
analysis, capital structure, and the cost of capital.  This course will
also provide an introduction to bonds and stocks.  Upon completion of
this course, you will understand financial statements, cash flow, time
value of money, stocks and bonds, capital budgeting, ratio analysis, and
long term financing, and apply these concepts and skills in business
decisions.

### Course Information

Welcome to BUS202 Principles of Finance. Below, please find general
information on this course and its requirements.  
    
 **Course Designe**r: Claudia Araiza, PhD  
    
 **Primary Resources**: This course makes primary use of the following
materials:  

-   Ivo-Welch: Dr. Ivo Welch’s "[Corporate
    Finance](http://book.ivo-welch.info/ed2/)" (2<sup>nd</sup> edition),
    Online Finance Textbook
-   University of West Florida: Dr. Richard Constand’s [FIN 4424 -
    Problems in Financial
    Management](http://uwf.edu/rconstand/fin4424web/FIN4424.htm), Online
    Lectures and Assignments
-   Khan Academy: Finance, Online Lectures
-   The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania: Dr. Michael R.
    Roberts’ Finance 100: Corporate Finance, Online Assignments

**Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and its assignment materials.  In
addition, you must complete the assignments for each unit and subunits
as indicated in the instructions.  
    
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the resources and assignments for each unit.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment**: This course should take you a total of **133.5
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These
should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a
look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you have
over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 8.5 hours.  Perhaps you
can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete half of subunit
1.1 (2 hours) on Monday night; the rest of subunit 1.1 (about 1.75
hours) on Tuesday night; subunit 1.2 (2 hours) on Wednesday night;
etc.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions**: It is advisable to follow these tips:  

-   Complete the units and all sub-units in the order as they appear.
-   Get acquainted with Microsoft Excel before you begin this course as
    many of the assignments involve using Excel. You can find several
    tutorial sites on the web but this one is especially recommended:
    Florida Gulf Coast University: Technology Skills Orientation:
    “[Excel 2000
    Tutorial](http://www.fgcu.edu/support/office2000/excel/index.html)”
-   The author of the main textbook, Dr. Ivo Welch, highly suggests that
    you use a robust internet browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla
    Firefox, Apple Safari, Camino, Opera, or Konqueror to view the
    online textbook. Microsoft’s Internet Explorer is compatible with
    the textbook but it is better to use the latest version (version 9).
    You can read about other suggestions for viewing the online textbook
    in Dr. Ivo Welch’s information site for the textbook: “[Corporate
    Finance (2<sup>nd</sup> edition)](http://book.ivo-welch.info/ed2/)”
