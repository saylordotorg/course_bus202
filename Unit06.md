**Unit 6: Application: The Capm Model** <span id="6"></span> 
*Unit 6 gives you an application in finance that puts what you have
learned from the previous units about cost of capital, net present
value, and risk into one widely used model: The CAPM model. The CAPM
model is used to compute a company’s costs of capital that can be used
in net present value calculations.  It has been used in court cases for
estimating a company’s stock value as with the case of the breakup of
AT&T in 1984 that resulted in seven companies.  Also, the CAPM model is
used in computing stock valuation.  This unit will show how the
financial manager uses this financial tool to value stock and to
determine which stocks are the better options for investors, based on
their rates of returns and how they compare to the overall stock market
return.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 18 hours to complete.

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Explain what the CAPM measures and its components.
-   Compute a company’s expected rate of return using past stock data.
-   Apply the results from the CAPM model into net present value
    calculations.
-   Make better financial decisions based on a company’s expected rate
    of return calculation.

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read Chapter 9 in the textbook.  This chapter
    explains a commonly used model for computing the return of a company
    using stock prices: The CAPM model.  Specifically, the CAPM model is
    used to compute a company’s costs of capital value that can be used
    in the net present value calculations.  It has been used in court
    cases for estimating a company’s stock value.  Also, make sure to
    answer the questions given at the end of each section in Chapter 9
    and compare your answers to the answers given at the end of the
    chapter under the heading titled “Answers.”  This resource covers
    the topics outlined in sub-subunits 6.1.1 and 6.1.2.  This reading
    should take you approximately 8 hours to complete.

**6.1.1 Definition of the CAPM Model** <span id="6.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 6.1.  The CAPM
model is used to calculate a company’s cost of capital using stock data.
 It considers the riskiness of a stock compared to the overall return in
the stock market.  Specifically, it provides an expected rate of return
of a company, which can be used as part of the interest rate value in a
net present value (NPV) calculation.*

**6.1.2 CAPM Formula** <span id="6.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resources in subunit 6.1. The CAPM
formula is as follows:*

*Expected Return of Stock A =*

**Risk-free return + (Expected Stock Market Return – Risk-free
return)xBeta of A**

*where all the returns are known from actual data but the beta value is
computed using a sophisticated statistical model called “regression
analysis.”  Using historical stock data, a regression model estimates
the value of a company’s beta.  Once the value of beta is known, we can
estimate the expected rate of return of a stock.  For example: Suppose
that a risk-free asset (such as a U.S. government bond) pays 1% as
interest, the stock market return is 10% on average, and a company’s
beta is 2.  Then the expected return of that company’s stock will be:
1 + (10-1)x2 = 1 + 18 = 19%.*
